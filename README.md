Now I've had the time of my life <br/>
No, I never felt like this before<br/>
Yes I swear, it's the truth<br/>
And I owe it all to you<br/>
'Cause I've had the time of my life<br/>
And I owe it all to you<br/>

I've been waiting for so long<br/>
Now I've finally found someone<br/>
To stand by me<br/>
We saw the writing on the wall<br/>
As we felt this magical fantasy<br/>

Now with passion in our eyes<br/>
There's no way we could disguise it secretly<br/>
So we take each other's hand<br/>
'Cause we seem to understand<br/>
The urgency<br/>

Just remember<br/>
You're the one thing<br/>
I can't get enough of<br/>
So I'll tell you something<br/>
This could be love because<br/>

I've had the time of my life<br/>
No, I never felt this way before<br/>
Yes, I swear, it's the truth<br/>
And I owe it all to you<br/>
Hey, baby<br/>

With my body and soul<br/>
I want you more than you'll ever know<br/>
So we'll just let it go<br/>
Don't be afraid to lose control, no<br/>
Yes, I know what's on your mind<br/>
When you say, "Stay with me tonight" (stay with me)<br/>

Just remember<br/>
You're the one thing<br/>
I can't get enough of<br/>
So I'll tell you something<br/>
This could be love because<br/>

I've had the time of my life<br/>
No, I never felt this way before<br/>
Yes, I swear, it's the truth<br/>
And I owe it all to you<br/>

'Cause I've had the time of my life<br/>
And I've searched though every open door<br/>
'Til I found the truth<br/>
And I owe it all to you<br/>

Now I've had the time of my life<br/>
No, I never felt this way before<br/>
Yes, I swear, it's the truth<br/>
And I owe it all to you<br/>

I've had the time of my life<br/>
No, I never felt this way before<br/>
Yes, I swear, it's the truth<br/>
And I owe it all to you<br/>

'Cause I've had the time of my life (the time of my life)<br/>
And I've searched though every open door<br/>
'Til I found the truth<br/>
And I owe it all to you<br/>
